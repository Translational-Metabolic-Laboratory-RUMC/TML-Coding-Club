# TML Coding Club
The **Translational Metabolic Laboratory (TML) Coding Club** is a peer-to-peer learning community built for TML colleagues. A coding club is a fun way to learn the basics of computer programming, gain problem solving and logical thinking skills and help each other along the way. The TML Coding Club is for everyone, regardless of their career stage or current level of knowledge. 

The coding club currently is being led by:

**Dr. Purva Kulkarni**<br/>

|    1    | 29 May 2020 | 16:30 - 17:00 | Launch of TML Coding Club and introduction |

## Additional info ##

- The club will be organized at a certain frequency - We need to decide that
- Everyone (begineers, intermediate, advanced) is free to join
- The idea is to learn new scripting related topics to discuss coding club challenges in more of an informal environment
- The coding club sessions will not be recorded
- We all can learn something new, here are a few ideas:
	- Coding club challenges (bring your own data)
	- New topics in R coding (say for example we follow a book and somebody presents a single chapter each time)
	- Basic linux commands
	- The power of Latex
	- Data visualisation and graphics
